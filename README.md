## About Me

I graduated from The University of Iowa in May 2024, earning degrees in Business Analytics & Information Systems and Sport and Recreation Management. Additionally, I earned an Event Management Certificate to guide my ultimate goal of working in the motorsport industry. My passion for motorsports stems from my continuing interest in cars and racing. I am eager to enhance my skills and gain additional experience in any way that presents itself.
